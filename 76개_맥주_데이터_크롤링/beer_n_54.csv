The very first beer that I drank. It tasted so gross. But I now wish I could drink it again. Sadly not available in Bangladesh anymore.

Keep to the positives. Its cheap, it is drinkable and it actually looks good. Thats where it ends as it feels if the invented water that got you drunk then this would be it.
