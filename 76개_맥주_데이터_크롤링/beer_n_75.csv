Pours a lite straw color, with thin white head. It is indeed a classic pilsner. Nothing too noteworthy here. Drinkable enough, with just a touch of hoppy bite. Move along.

Becoming quite popular around here but it beats me why.  The bottles I tried were shot through with an unpleasant metallic tang and oddly textured.

A good beer for light meals. I've always thought it had a slightly metallic aftertaste. Usually I buy it in the mini-keg form for a small gathering.

The best selling beer in Germany, Warsteiner is a passable German-style Pilsner.  Dry for the style, but still floral and smooth.  Bitterness cranks my rating up a notch or two.
