Blik geprobeerd op vakantie. Het is een donkerbruin bier met een wat rode gloed en een stevig beige schuim. Het heeft een moutige geur. De smaak is moutig, licht bitter en wat wrang.

The beer is called Schwarzbier, but its not like the German Schwarzbier. With the chocolate and coffee hints, the beer tends to a Porter. Nice and drinkable.
