Bevuta alla spina in bicchiere da 0,33. Birra discreta, dal sapore non elaborato ma godibile, ho gradito anche il livello di carbonatura non eccessivamente invadente.

Nice easy drinking style. Had nice smooth dark malt flavours with hints of coffee. A round and smooth palate and good head retention.

Pours with a fantastic large head of foam.  Otherwise this is a refreshing dunkle weisse with a light malty flavour.  Perhaps too light and thin on the palate.
