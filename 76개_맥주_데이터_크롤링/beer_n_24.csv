美味しい、けど大手故の薄さ。香りはその名の通りモルツだが、強くはない。苦味が少なく、後味にキレの良さが目立つ。総じて非常に飲みやすい、癖のないビール。料理の邪魔をしない事は確か、ただこれ単体で飲むのはさびいしいか。

Light yellow with minimal head.  Sugary on the mouth with a hint of pine on the nose.  Better than a lot of other mainstream beers.

Slightly hazy straw colour.  Big, almost sugary malt aroma.  Clean, fresh malt taste.  A little grainy in the finish, but pretty good macrobrew.

This is IMHO the best beer Japan has to offer out of the macrobrews. Nice head and great flavor. Beats all Kirins, Sapporos, and Asahis.
