Sweet and light and crisp. Like a Busan autumn morning. Easy drinking but sucrosey. Perhaps the PBR of Korea.

This is not a beer I can highly recommend. Sweet, watery, and tasteless. Reminds me of a cheap American beer. On the other hand this beer could be a total life saver on a hot summer day. Very easy drinking!

Thuis uit een flesje. Nu allemaal niet zo mopperen hierop. Een fris pils met een laag percentage. Lekker voor de dorst op een warme dag. Ok, niet heel veel smaak en nasmaak. Helder geel, aardig koolzuur.

Purchased a six pack from my local 99 cents store. Short lived white head atop a clear, pale yellow body. It has a metallic smell, common with cheaply mass produced beer. The taste is bland and watery. Not something craft beer lovers should seek out.
