Certainly wouldn't win any award anytime soon but it tastes alright and is highly accessible. At the price point, you can beat it but it may run 3rd or 2nd best on a good day. Cheap and not really cheerful.

Average compared to other lagers, typical mass market product.  Doesn''t offend, but there are much better beers to be had.

Both watery and dry. Full of contradictions, but in the hot australian summer days it's a defendable investment.

This is a very good Australian beer with a fine hopsy and somewhat bitter taste to it. But that is a good thing!
