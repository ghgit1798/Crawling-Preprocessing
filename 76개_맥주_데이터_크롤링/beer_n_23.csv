Pours yellow with a thick white head and heavy carbonation. Aroma of lemonade. Taste has very sweet lemonade and a slight bitter note. Palate has a barely detectable element of beer. Very soda-like.

500ml can. Pours cloudy white yellow. Lemon, a real lemon curd type thing. Not much beer left. Looks, tastes and smells like quite a nice lager shandy. Fine by me.

This is a caught in between kind of product, not as shandy as other shandy, at the same time, not as beer as other beer (if it is a beer at all).

Tried at a tasting in Sai Kung. Not especially noteworthy but nice and refreshing if you want a Radler. Very drinkable at 2%. Carbonation is not too aggressive, which I like.
