Costs less than bottled water. Tastes about the same. Pours fizzy yellow. Watery taste with very little hop and the taste of straw. Crisp, light finish.

This isn't a good beer. A little bit better than Miller Lite but really does not satisfy any taste buds. Has a little sweeter taste than High Life.
