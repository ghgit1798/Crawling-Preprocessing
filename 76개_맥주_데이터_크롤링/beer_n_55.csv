Why make a pilsener with too much alcohol? It doesn''t add anything to the usual taste. It just makes the palate more alcoholic.

Pretty awful, the alcohol is way too evident, quite sweet, and just plain crappy. Do yourself a favour and never drink this.

Sweet aroma, yellow, fluffy head. Sweet, strong alcohol presence. Highly carbonated, alcohol isn't hidden, hard to finish.

Unfortunately for this one, 16 spoonfulls of sugar don't make this medicine go down.  I'm with Oakes, this one was disgusting.
