250ml can at FL330 on KLM. It’s not a bad beer but nothing really exciting about it.  It’s a plain Ducth Lager.

En klassisk lättdrucken öl utan överraskningar. Lite av allt utom kolsyra. Helt ok öl el varm sommardag som törstsläckare, men duger föga till annat.

I know that this beer used to have some kind of pedigree, but I don’t get it. The only difference between this and bud is that this tastes skunkier. Might be the most over rated beer ever.

Golden colour with a bubbly head. Bad aroma, while the flavour (like many other ""commercial"" lagers) is dominated by the bitterness of the hops. Drinkable, but nothing special.

A slight grassyness to the flavor profile, a slight bit of hop finish.  Other than that, unremarkable, but much, much better than any American Standard I've ever had.
