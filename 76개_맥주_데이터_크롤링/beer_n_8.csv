This beer is either very bad, or i cant drink dry stout. Its taste and aroma was really poor. Possibly the most overrated beer in the world.

Guinness is your classic pretty boy beer. It has a relatively darker taste, which can overfill, but has a great appearance and aroma.

Dark, black colour with one finger off white head. Taste is flat with almost no carbonation, notes of coffee, mocca, and a little bit of chocolate. Very malty, bitter aftertaste.  Not bad.

Its the classic Guinness.  You know how it pours, you know the aroma.  It’s taste is thin and has that mild burnt malt taste, clean finish.  Its tradition, little more than that though.

Fad. orholdsvis kedelig dry stout. Men stadig flot og lækker at se på. Med en ok fornemmelse i munden. Men smagen er moderat brændt og i længden både flad og kedelig.

If Guinness had some umph to it and was 7% it would be a kick ass beer. But at 4.1% it’s a frat boy beer. But I do enjoy it once in a while. I’ve heard it’s great in Ireland.
