Хорошее, утоляющее жажду пиво и гасящее жар от острой китайской кухни. По крайней мере лучше светлого Spaten или мерзкого Warsteiner. Не очень горькое, не кислое, в меру сладкое. Беру его всегда. И в Китае его тоже всегда пью.…

Just don't get your hopes up. It's a light lager from China. Of course it's going to taste like metal, corn and water - it's supposed to. Unfortunately, despite feeling refreshing at first, the aftertaste is too unpleasant for even my liking.
