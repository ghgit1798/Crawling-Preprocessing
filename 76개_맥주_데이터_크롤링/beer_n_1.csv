A small can from Chuan Lien down the road. Typical Korean macrobrew; plenty of rather sour vanilla, not disgusting, easy drinking.

Tastes like most Korean lager. Like it is the lager from that grey can Lister carries around in Red Dwarf. ...Very generic and mild tasting. Carbonated and thirst quenching, yet nondescript.

Almost orange amber colour. On the nose, maltish, on the palate more plasticy sort of phenol-accented malt stuff. Ok for industrial Korean swill.

가볍습니다. 너무 가벼워서 오히려 자리가 애매한 국산 타 맥주보다 특징이 뚜렷하네요. 국산 맥주중 가장 가볍게 즐기기 좋은 맥주입니다.
