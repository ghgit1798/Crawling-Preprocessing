Aroma's are bittersweet with hints of metallic. Flavors are like nose but slightly more sweet than bitter. Decent body and carbonation with an okay finish.

Then moves into a tangy bum juice finish with the crisp taste of grass coming through

Fles gedronken op Mallorca, het is een goudgeel bier met weinig schuim. Het heeft een gistachtig aroma. De smaak is moutig en wat hoppig.

A very nice beer. It is bitter and crisp and you can taste that it is quite strong. However - for some reason it is the only beer of which I can only drink 2-3 bottles until heart burn kicks in.

good lager beer, with a certain sweetness to it (not as bitter as most lager beers). Pale golden glow, 2 fingers of foam, excellent on a hot summer.

This is a very dissapointing beer, so much for the reassuringly expensive advertising. It is over-rated and not something I will be rushing out to buy again.

This smooth pale golden beer has a slightly sour, bitter aroma and flavor.  However, compared to some of the ""Big"" beers of the same style , this one beats them out.
