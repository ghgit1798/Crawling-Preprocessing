On draught in Jeju. Copper colour and low to medium carbonation. No aroma and very little taste. Some caramel, syrup and rice. No noticeable hop flavour. Very poor.

On tap, clear amber, medium head and nice lacing. Aroma of macro lager malts, flat. Tastes medium bitter, strong corn syrup and rice, not much more. Struggling with this.

0.33l bottle. Nice one! A non-pale lager in Korea? Amazing.. Anyhow, this is a clear deep deep red beer with a small quickly fading off-white head that sticks nicely to the sides…

Lyckas väcka sinnena ur sin djupa slummer genom att milt ruska om med sin väna alkoholstyrka. Inget för historieböckerna, ej heller för de riktigt kräsna finsmakarna,…

Dark redish color with a creamy looking head.  Head did not last, nor did it taste creamy.  Overwhelming rye flavor what was harsh at the end.  One of the best korean macros.

Dark in color with reddish tint. Bitter flavor, knockoff of a Killians irish red for Koreans. Smell was skunky. Not very pleasant, unless there was nothing else.

Coming from Canada, I expected this to have some body, maybe a full malty flavour with a nice bitterness to balance.  This has none of that.  It is red however.  Very mild flavour…

Non pasteurized and nonflavorful Korean beer from OB. I think Miller Lite has more flavor than this one. Big fizzy head, slight red color and flavorless.
