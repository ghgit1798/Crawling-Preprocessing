Pale lager with almost no color - like a faint yellow sparkling water.  Aroma of corn.  Fizzy - tolerable with a lime wedge, but barely drinkable without one.

Bottle.  A light clear yellow.  The aroma is a little sour, a touch of skunk, a bit sweet.  It almost stings on the first sip but settles into an all too familiar bad lager taste.
