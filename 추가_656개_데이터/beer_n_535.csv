I rescued this from Zach pouring it down the drain.  Oh man.  Painful aroma, each sniff causes me to turn away and cringe.  Steel reserve comes to mind.  Apperance is very light,…

Flat looking beer, though its appearance is saved by its semi frothy head.  Hoppy pilsner but lacks flavour with its bitterness.

Pale yellow color with very little head.  Somewhat metallic flavor with mild hoppiness in the finish.  Not great, but better than most American brews.

Straw coloured, low head moderate condition. Hints of caramel and maple syrup in the nose, some malt in the mouth and finish but fairly bland and uninspiring

Dito the previous raters comments.  It tastes great when it's red hot and you're thirsty, otherwise its quite bland.

I guess this tastes pretty o.k if you're in Cyprus. But otherwise I guess not. Bland and boring.

Pale yellow color.  Very faint aroma (if any) of hops - light fruit.  Tinny, fizzy, little bitterness, dry finish.  Almost a raspberry type fruitiness.

A nice white head with very faint aroma.  Very faint overall.  Considering, there are very few faults which make it an easy beer to drink, just not real satisfying.

Another pilsner with a fair aroma but almost no taste. Crisp enough...I guess...when cold, but drink it fast 'cuz it's kind of downhill from there.
