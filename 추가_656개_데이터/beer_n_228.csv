Vienna: Pale yellow with thick white head.  Not as sharp and assertive as others; slightly fruity and sweet.  No metallic flavors associated.  I prefer this over their others.

June 2001 - Very disappointed in this. A very thin beer. Wouldn't waste my time on this one again. The only saving grace is that the bottle is cool and will make my next batch…

Little head, lacking nice clear golden color of most Pilseners and the taste is just downright foul.

Not very hoppy. Slightly malty finish. Nice warming pilsner. Had this in Austria near the brewery. One of my favorite pilseners, though pilsener isn't one of my favorite styles.

Fruity aroma, but the taste didn't live up to that. But it had a good volume, and a long and dry finish.

Maybe it was because I was on vacation (German restaurant in Niagara Falls - 2001), but I thought this stuff was great.  It had a unique fruity/spicy flavor and aroma which I enjoyed.
