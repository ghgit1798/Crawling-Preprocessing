350 mL bottle.  Light yellow color with white head.  Barely noticeable aroma and taste.  If it wasn’t for the malt, I would have been certain that this was yellow alcoholic soda water.

""Italian Budweiser""? I understand the moniker. This was ricey,skunky, and pretty watery. Thought it was decent with pizza, but then I drank it by itself. Truly vile.

What do Italians know from beer? It's called Moretti! Drink this ti fnish your list at a local bar, and be done with it. Too many hops, not good at all.
