Pale straw colour with a very short lasting head. Doughy malt aroma that wasn’t very nice. Taste wasn’t very balanced, off grapefruit and also watered down sour milk.

sweet, grainy, clag-like lager, with a tangy industrial bitterness. motelpogo described kvass as like lemonade and stale bread - this seems pretty similar.
