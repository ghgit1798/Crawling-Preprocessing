Rich golden color with a slight ring of foam, this beer performed considerably better than my expectations warranted. Nice oktoberfest-marzen malt profile in aroma…

Not bad, but nothing special either. A great beer to sample however if you see it, and cant decide on what else to get.

Hmmm.  The aroma and taste have hints of sweetness.  It’s a somewhat bitter beer without a lot of complexity.  I enjoyed it nonetheless.

A pretty good beer from Czech Republic.  Though, not my favorite, it was satisfactory.  A decent beer to sit on a bench and drink with your pizza, as I did in Prague the other month.

Bright clean saaz hop aroma.  Firm nice malt flavor.  Hops reced as you drink it, leaving mostly just bitterness.  This Czech pilsener travels better than most.

Light smokey aroma. Deep golden, fluffy head. Sweet malt and smoked hops? Really interesting. Slightly acidic. Good and different.

Decent enough pilsner, but not hoppy enough for me. Doesn't reach the level of Urquell or Czechvar. I've only tried the canned version--perhaps bottled is much better?

Had this a while ago, no longer available here but it was virtually the same as Kozel, perhaps not as malty.

When I was in Prague Radegast was my favourite brewer and I still think theirs are the best pilsners I have ever had.

Good ingredients, but needs to decide what it is. Both pilsner and hefe fans will be confused as hell. Good ingredients are present, however.

Pleasant Czech lager, but lacking in assertiveness.  The malt accent is of quality flavour, but I guess I'm just looking for a little more bite in my Czech pils.
