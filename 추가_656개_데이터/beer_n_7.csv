Darker than many Weissebiers, orange amber with moderate rocky head and plenty of condition. Not as good as weihenstephan but way better than Erdinger.

This beer has a nice foam with a pale brown colour. Its aroma is quite discreet with notes of yeast. The flavour is a little bit flat with a quite short finish
