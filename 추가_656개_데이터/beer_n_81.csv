Pour from can, this beer looks gold and clear with almost no head. Smell a bit alcohol and it has the accompanying dry bitterness. Drinkable but not really enjoyable.

Light gold color, medium head. Light tasting, slightly hoppy. Fairly standard pilsner style beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Nice balance. Nice, but nothing special. Finish is clean.…

A drinkable beer.  Nothing special.  More malty than it should be.  Had it had a bit more hop, it would have been twice the beer it is.  All in all, not a bad beer, clean if nothing else.

A weak, bland brew.  Any flavor there is quickly fades away with each drink because it is such a watery brew.  Drinkable and not horrible, but nothing to remember either.
