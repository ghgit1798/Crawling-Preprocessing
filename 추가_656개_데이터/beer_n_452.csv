Better than I expected, but I wasn’t expecting much.  Pale yellow, head actually tried to hang around a while.  Grainy aroma, bit of cornflakes.  Carbonation too sharp, but relative…

Pours a fizzy yellow with a medium white head. Clear bottle spells doom as I can smell the skunk! The aroma is atrocious! Rotten corn and wet paper would probably describe it best.…

Bottle: I tried the salvadorean version, clear, pale yellow pours a small head. For a Corona me-too it's quite refrshing and uninsulting though overall unimpressive.

Not much taste.  High carbonation.  Smells like a miller lite.  An average ""beer"" with an american taste.
