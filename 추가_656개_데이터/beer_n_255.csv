A yellow beer with a collapsing head. The aroma is like soapwater mixed with malt. The flavor is malty with an OK hoppyness leading to a dry end. But the body is thin.

Thanks to Circle Liquors and my friend Paul, I have now had Cintra. Is it good? Is it bad? No. It’s your basic boring and bland European Lager. Is it better than Strohs Light? Yes.…

very cheap, and at least it’s in a brown bottle. doesn’t taste to bad for a cheapo lager. goes flat very fast, and is a bit sweet. to call it a pilsner though is ridiculous. just another pale lager.
