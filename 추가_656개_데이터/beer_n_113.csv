Not bad: golden colour, clean hoppy taste good head. Not one of the best pilsener beers around, a bit watery but still drinkable.

Goes down very easy. Always reach for one when wonna have a good pils. It has a very nice bitter fishing that most of pils lack. The only downside is that it is a little too strong.
