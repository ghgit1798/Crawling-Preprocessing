Pale yellow. Sweetish, not much flavour, except perhaps some weird adjunct. A sub-standard lager, also for being only 2.8%.

Garden variety lager.  Sweet, not hoppy.  Light carbonation. Slightly stinky yeast.  If this is the zenith of French brewing, then it's no surprise they turned their attention to wine.
