One of the weaker German pils. Wierd aftertaste. Go Becks or St. Pauli if you must go with a big commercialfor this style.

A below average lager with a cheap malty flavor. Metallic, bourbon-like aftertaste. Metallic. Better than many ""green-bottle"" beers but nothing worth seeking out.

A really nice sweet aroma, followed by a light pilsener flavor that''s not all that German in style.  Light on the Saaz, this DAB is an acceptable choice.  Soapy?
