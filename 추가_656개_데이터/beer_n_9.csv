Pours very cloudy, with the yeast; pale straw in color. Aroma hints at the sourness that soon hits the mouth.  Sour  apple notes match the chalky acidity. Simplitic malt, chalkk finish.…

A confusing beer, but good nevertheless. The head died rapidly, and the beer itself is paler than Rolling Rock. It took a few sips to get the hang of the flavor; sort of a less musty…

Make sure you have a rasberry or woodruff additive. Otherwise you will be forced to dump it.
