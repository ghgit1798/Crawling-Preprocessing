A kind of ""creamy"" flavored lager, and a decent flavor, but nothing to write home about.  I've had a lot better...and worse!

Golden color. Sweet malt and some butter in aroma. Very flavourful but a bit one-dimensional. Quite hoppy finish with hints of spices and nuts.

Golden & sweet it's not your ordinary czech pils. The flavour arrives immediately and feels the palate with thick juicy sweeetness. You can get this and many other czech beeres…
