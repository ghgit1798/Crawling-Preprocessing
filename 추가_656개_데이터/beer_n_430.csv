A typical tropical lager - pale yellow, fizzy head.  The nose and body are nothing to speak of.  Different country though!                                                                                                                                                                                   .

Skunky hop aroma. Pale yellow color, white head, few lace. Almost no flavors, little grainy, some hop bitterness, very light. It does the job when it’s very hot but nothing interestin…

Compact and adherent foam, good persistence. Yellow color, limpid and clearly; little fizzy. Ordinary and light scent. It deprives of particular characteristics, lightly metallic taste.

Neutral aroma, can’t really pick up anything. Light golden pale appearance with little to no head. Flavor has a bit of biscuity malt sweetness to it with a brief hop bitterness in the back…

I'm going to go against the grain on this one, somewhat. IMHO, the 4's and 5's ratings on this beer are unmerited. Maybe it's because I'm having a crappy beer expedition on…

A very bad beer.  Lugged a case of this one mile in 98 degree heat and 98% humidity in Aruba.  Not worth the effort.  Better be chilled or it is unforgiving.  Not a complex beer at all.…
