Classic Eastern Pils, strong oily leatherwood taste with yummy mollasses hints. Good with hot weather, curries and sex. Not for the faint-hearted.

This is a great pilsner lager. Smooth, malty and hoppy.  Definitely a great beer.  It's a shame that A-B thinks they should be able to use the ""Budweiser"" name because…

Golden colour.  Light saaz aroma.  Flavour is relatively sweet for style, with hints of bread and saaz.  If found fresh, tends to exude a more pungent hop character and more assertive…
