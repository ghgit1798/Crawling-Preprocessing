Almost exactly like Windhoek Lager.  I can’t tell them apart at all.  Enjoyed near Sossusvlei, Namibia, but available almost anywhere in Namibia and in parts of S. Africa.

Medium golden body with a fairly lasting white head. Aroma of malt and adjuncts. Taste is sweet, pretty thin and boring.

One of the best beers I ever drank. A bit stronger in flavour than the ""Windhoek"". Great!

The best of the local Capetown SA beers.  More body and flavor than your typical Hansa or Castle.  Smooth and refreshing with a very smooth finish.  Very little aftertaste.…

Golden colour. With Hansa's lovely Urbock in mind it is disappointingly thin. Not much in the way of flavour or bitterness either. Not one of Namibia's top beers.

A beautiful head forms on pouring, which retains more than half its size for well over a minute. Distinct maltyness, balanced well with just enough bitterness. Light amber in…
