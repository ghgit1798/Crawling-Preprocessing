I just found this on tap locally, and being a sucker for new brands, I gave it a shot. I found this to be a very enjoyable stout! It has a strong roast bite on the front end with a…

Bottle.  A bitter roast burnt bite hits right away followed by a strong aftertaste typical of most stouts.  Overall, I was unimpressed with this beer.  A little too spritzy and more…

I am not much of a fan of stouts, yet I found this to be a bit tastier than Guiness.  It was dark, rich, nutty, chocolatey and smooth.  The bite was was more bearable than that of…

A descent stout, but not the best Irish Stout I have had.  Nice roasted nutty taste though.  Also a very smoothe aftertaste.

With Irish Stouts I always find myself comparing relative to Guinness...and in this case, I'd give Guinness the nod.  O'Hara presents more of a malty-sweet taste to it than Guinness,…

Not bad but I would not pass up a Guinness or Murphy's stout for one of these. Less carbonation would be an improvement.

Not a bad stout. About the same overall quality as Guinness or maybe a tad bit better.  Once again, Guinness is overrated.
