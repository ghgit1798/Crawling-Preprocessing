The taste indeed is quite unique, a lot of herbal aroma. Bitter taste. But I’m not sure if this uniqueness makes it good or just strange. After first Jever I’m not a fan.

This is my favorite beer in the world.  Unfortuantely it isn't very accessible here in the US.  I love the hoppiness of this North German beer.

Drink this only fresh in Hamburg and you'll find it an ultimate pilsener. Too bitter for my German pals, but what do they know..only joking.
