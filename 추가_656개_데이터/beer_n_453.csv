Small white head that didn’t last long. Pale, golden hay color - very clear. Very mild yeasty aroma. Flavor is a little bready with a slightly bitter and dry finish. Dull and boring

Bottle to glass mug.  Pours a light yellow, clear with virtually no head.  Very weak flavors of light citrus, and sweet malts.  It’s really watery.  The carbonation is very lively.

Had this bottle a couple years ago.  Nothing special.  Typical mexican lager.  Thin, barely any flavor unless you put a lime in it.  Good on a hot day while youre cooking out.

Bottle.  Waldo’s Pizza KC.  Very normal lager.  Not much aroma, not much taste.  At one point, I thought I caught a dirty dish rag vibe, but it passed.
