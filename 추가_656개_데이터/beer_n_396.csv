The piece of lemon or lime is the only thing that can make this corn juice bearable. Acidic aroma, plain taste, pale watered golden. For binge drinking.

Yes it looks like soemthing other than beer, lacks flavor and the aroma is lacking.  However forget the lemon or lime and sometimes it isn't that bad. Still better than ""beast""
