Copper pour with fizzy whute head.  Mild hop aroma, mixed with some malts.  Fruity malty brew with low hop presence  I certainly wouldn’t classify it as an ESB, or a pale ale for that…

One of my favorite main-stream beers.  Amber in color.  Slight malty/caramel nose.  Same start, thin middle, slight bitter finish.  Not the greatest, but not offending.

A little bitterness is the aftertaste, but it is a good bitterness.  Kind of reminds of Harp, but they definitely aren't twins. I was a little surprised that it worsened as it warmed.

Nice Amber/Red color. Sweet malty nose. If served too cold, let this sit and warm a bit. Good flavor with a nice nutty aftertaste. Not one of the elite but still a great pub ale.

Decent beer - looks really nice when the barkeep hands you the pint.  Nice bubbly head and dark copper color.  But the overall taste isn't top notch with me - I can't quite get over…

A classic.  This is one of the beers that originally turned me on to quality beer.  It has a familiar metallic flavour from the hard water derived from the limestone at Burton Upon Trent.

Very nice, very enjoyable.  A good beer for the novice to try. Just a hint of bitterness, but not so much that it couldn't be enjoyed by those who are accustomed to drinking the ""Big 3"".

Oh, Bass...Sister to Guinness.  I'm not normally an Ale drinker, but this is not a wussie ale.  Full bodied, and refreshing!!  A little pricey, but the best things in life are.  Go get some!

I don't like the taste of this beer. But when left with no choice I will drink it. For some reason, I can only drink one pint of Bass: It must have the right combination to blow me away.

This was not bad out of the bottle.  Tasted like a really good version of a macrobrew such as bud.  Had a better color for sure, and a better test to boot, but not a fantastic beer.

If you have it on cask, it's quite nice, but in the bottle it's not much more than English ale for people who don't actually like the taste of real English ale.
