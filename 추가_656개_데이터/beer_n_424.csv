Bar Piselli, Lima. Small soap foam, weak clear yellow gold. Foamy, oddly fruity cardboard. Extremely modest bitter note. Annoying that it is more flavorful than refreshing. Meh.

It is a boring lager, nothing special. The color is yellow gold, thin foam, average carbonation. The hop doesn’t exist or too discreet and the malt or corn or the both are too sweet. I…

Bottle in Trujillo, just your average macro lager with a taste of mostly corn on a fizzy yellow body. Ok but drink it cold.

Looks okay, but otherwise just a typical south american pilsner. Very grainy flavor, little hop presence, and flat, cardboard finish.

Bottle.  Light , but refreshing brew.  A hit of malt and not so much corn as other Latin American beers.  Good on a warm day.

Unimaginatively named and likewise brewed. This ""pilsener"" has the usual south american corniness, with a little bit of brown sugar flavour thrown in for interest.
