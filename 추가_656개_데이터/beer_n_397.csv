Pours a straw with a head that doesn’t last and some lacing. Aroma and taste are light, mostly corn with a hint of malt and typical pale lager hops. Prefer it over many other pale lagers.

Yes, it’s industrial lager.  Yes, it’s in a clear bottle.  But it’s not skunked which gives it a leg up on Corona.  It’s 99 outside and this is actually tasting decent at the moment.

Seems like FEMSA's answer to Corona. Fizzy, seltzer-like beer with little flavor except for some heavily cooked grain flavors. Would benefit from some lime probably.
