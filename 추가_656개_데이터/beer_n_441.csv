Pours a clear yellow with a small yellow head. Both aroma and taste are the usual pale lager stuff. Don’t expect the world and you won’t be disappointed.

Bottle, a clear gold with a white frothy head. A strong grassy hop aroma. Very dry and bitter with a sweet malty flavour. Typical lager.

Another ""regional"" beer from one of Argentinas largest brewerys. Bland flavour, kind of like slightly soapy water.
