It’s the OK beer to have at big parties. Somewhat watery and plain but the price is good (around 0,75 US$ for a 1 litre bottle). Ice-cold serving makes it a bit better too.

Big Bottle. Pale yellowish colour with very short head. Weak aroma of malt and a little fruitiness. Moderate malty though still waterish malty flavour with weak hoppy dry finish.

More of the same thing. Seems like in Argentina every beer comes from the same tank and they only change the label. Plain, watery, I agree on the strong carbonation.
