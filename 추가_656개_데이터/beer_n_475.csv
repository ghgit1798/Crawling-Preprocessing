Z notatek. Przywiezione z Mongolii, dzięki Lech Żak. Kolor złoty, piana szybko znika. Aromat lekko słodowy, trawiasty. W smaku męczące, nijakie, niezbyt dobre.

Straw colour. Fairly appley aroma.  The palate is also a bit grainy, with notes of apple.  Not much malt character, but maybe some hop dryness.  Uninteresting.
