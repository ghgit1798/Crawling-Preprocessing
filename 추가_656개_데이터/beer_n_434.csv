Argentina's favorite, eh? Well, Hitler didn't drink... Slight malt in flavor and aroma, very slight bitterness. Light-bodied. Very little in the way of distinctive character.

Bottled. Straw gold, poor head and too much condition. Malt, starch and solvent aromas, peardrops in the mouth and a greasy finish that froths unsettlingly in your throat.

No aroma.  A rather disappointing taste - somewhat odd.  Grassy.  Rather flavorful, really, but it's strange.  Dry and malty.  Maybe a bit of sourness.
