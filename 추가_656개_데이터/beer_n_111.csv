Light colour with a good head. Sweet alcohol aroma. Lots of alcohol in the taste and a nasty afterburn.  It is more drinkable than most of its ilk.

Golden colour, no head. Alcohol in the aroma. The flavour is more balanced than expected, less sweet than other malt liquors, with a touch of bitterness in the aftertaste. Anyway,…

Death by lager...Although you wouldn't know it from aroma alone.  This is an astringent beer with a chemical aftertaste.  Having said that - its not bad for a malt liquor.
