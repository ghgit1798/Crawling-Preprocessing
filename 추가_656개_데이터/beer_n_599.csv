What a great session beer.  Light fluffyhead that disapates quickly.  Light, grainy malt flavors witha slight hop finish that dries the mouth.

My friend said it best when he said ""This beer smels like bread"".  If this is Zimbabwe's best export, I really hope they are concured by someone VERY soon.

Bleh. No redeeming qualities to this beer. Seriously, if you're going to import beers between continents, do NOT use green bottles.

Skunky corn and wheat aroma.  Taste is bland and flat, but not entirely awful.  Some rubber tire and tobacco flavors reside, but its just too bland to taste bad.
