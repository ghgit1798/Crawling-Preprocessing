It has the lot - great taste, it's easily drinkable, and perfect for all occasions.  If there's a better beer out there, I'm yet to find it!

Light golden, decent carbonation and moderate head. Odorless. Dry palate, slight sweetness but nothing much going on. Finishes dry and grainy.

Pretty bad.  Kinda thought I liked it at first, but then one made me dry heave the other day and that sort of turned me against it.  Beware.

Smells like my socks, has an odd flavour probably due to chemicals and is watery and sweet. Avoid, go straight to the Old - a far better beer.

Liquid carpet, so drink only in the absence of something else, like water. It tends to give the unfortunate victim a nasty hangover, too.
