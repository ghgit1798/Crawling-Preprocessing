Interesting. Quite an indescribable un-lagery flavor, reminding me perhaps of a lighter blond ale. Bitterness around the edges of my tongue. Tastes like maybe it's more than 5%.…

Nice head, but of a skunky smell.  Smooth flavor with very little after taste.  Nice and smooth, but nothing particularly notable.

big head that dissapates quickly and leaves little ""head-islands"" floating at the top.  very slight hops, and there was a kind of sourness that was not unpleasant.

Huge head from the pour.  Slight maltiness in the the body, and I mean very slight.  Little to no hoppiness throughout.  Drinkable.
