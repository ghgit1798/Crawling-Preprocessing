Bottled. An orange beer with a thin white head. The aroma is metalic malty, and the flavor is sweet with notes of metal and a hint of carraway seed(?), before a dry end sets in.

Bottle at RBESG 2006. Inoffensive brew, if a little boring. Seemed to have a bit more body to it than the crappier pale lagers.

Bottle. Very thin and boring pale lager. Some sweetish pale malt characters and lets face it, not a lot else. At least i got a new country off the list i suppose.

Canned. Golden colour, small white head. Aroma of sweet toffee, malts and hops. Flavour is caramel malts and hops. Surprisingly clean, but still not ""that"" pleasant.
