Unpleasant aroma of adjuncts. Almost no head. Clear golden body. Weak bitterness and almost no taste at all. Another unneeded reanimation.

Invitingly bright golden beer with nice head.  Sweet malty aroma.  Very good grainy malt flavoring with hint of citrus edge.  Very nice.

Clear, light golden, quickly dissapating head . Nose of clean malt. Very clean, drinkable, refreshing with a subtle hop bite. Balanced, well crafted but bland.

Full gold; lots of malt on the nose. Ditto the palate, with a good dose of Lublin hops.  Feels like drinking a nice Franconian hell and then a soft, Bohemian-esque hit of hops…

Golden, little lace.  Aroma is pilsner-esque, light hops.  Sweet/candyish malt presence that I find unpleasant.  Good hoppy finish.  Good pils.

Smells slightly wheaty and is fairly mild.  I like this a bit better than Okocim O.K. Beer because it's a hint more flavorful.
