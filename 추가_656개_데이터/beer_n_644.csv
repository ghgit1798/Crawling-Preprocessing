Totally awful. Every fifth bottle or so was not even beer, but something else I didn’t want to know. Cheap though, and after 6 or 7 of them in the Tongan sunset I kinda enjoyed it.

Flops into the glass like a decapitated goldfish... dull, lifeless golden, with no head.  I can’t figure out which malts they use in this, it smells like atrociously stale ground coffee mixed…
