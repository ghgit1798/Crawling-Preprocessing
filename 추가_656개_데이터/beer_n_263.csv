Nice frothy head, golden color and a fresh hoparoma. Sweetish, malty yet fresh flavor with some apple and orange fruitiness. Not many hops in the flavor. Still not too bad.

Bright, blond/gold color. Malty richness, with the standard bitter bite of a pilsener.  OK, but not great.  Pretty standard.

RateBeer Summer (Toronto) '02: Light yellow color, slight malts and hops aroma, too fizzy, and ends slightly bitter.  Tastes better than the sum of its parts.

Golden, mild, slightly grassy finish.  Light on the hops for a Polish pilsner.

Not quite a pils,  More of a heavy lager in style.  Hopsack aroma and old malt flavors.  A bit to much body and thick sweetness.  Almost cloying

I had reservations but they were unfounded, as this was a decent brew. My major complaint is that this beer seemed way too overcarbonated. Otherwise there was nothing…
