Outstanding.  Chocolatey and bitter.  Plenty of roasted barley flavor.  Nicely dark with full head.  Rich aroma.

A nice Spring Beer.  The taste and palate of a stout without a sweetness or heavyness more appropriate to cold weather.

A first for me a ""Tropical Stout"", lighter in body and not so harsch. Great nose, vanilla, chocolate, and a bit of the hops at the finish. Quite good and a 8.0 ABV, mild but pleasing.

dense, rocky head.  Sweet, fruity nose.  Complex, malty - vanilla and coffee; creamy palate; light notes of raisins and plums.  Exquisite.
