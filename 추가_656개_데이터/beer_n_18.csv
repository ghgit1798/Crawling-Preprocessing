A srong lager in my mind, but didn't have the malt character of a bock.Quite bitter for a bock.

Really disappointed, i got a skunky bottle.  It was a pretty caramel color, with an off white head that really held up.  Tasted a bit skunked as well, with a bitter tang on the end.…

A tiny amount of skunk, with some background hop bitterness and caramel-like malt. Not bad, but I'd really like to try one that wasn't skunked at all.
