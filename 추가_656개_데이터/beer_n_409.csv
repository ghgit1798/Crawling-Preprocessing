Can in a bar in Havana on a very hot day. Looks like fizzy apple juice. Its a bit like Cuban Coors, incredibly bland yet somewhat refreshing in 35°C heat. Have Bucanero instead.

Something between  Mayabe and Cristal, this one is the typical industrial lager but wit a little bit more malty flavor. Not a worth try.
