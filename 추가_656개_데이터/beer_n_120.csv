Hoppier than some malt liquors. Alcohol is evident. I expected it to taste terrible, it was ok.

Mild carbonation.  Generic lager/malt liquor colour.  OK, mild hoppy nose.  Smells OK.  Bad , bad aftertaste.  That just ruins it.  blaacgghh.

Great giraffe on the label!, strong malt liquor taste, as you'd expect.  Decent head and I didn't think the alcohol is that well hidden.  Not great.
