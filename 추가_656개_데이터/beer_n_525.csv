Light gold colour.  Some straw aroma, may hop, but that’s subject to debate.  Somewhat unpleasant minerally astringency.  Only has shades of grain/hop.  Not so good.

Well I was expect a better strong beer. But when u drink you don’t feel bitterness nor a strong beer taste. Bit like grassy and watery. You can only found it on can at the moment.
