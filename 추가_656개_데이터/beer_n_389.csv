Crisp, nice hop character, reasonably bitter with a feint sweetness in the background. Not a fan of the colour, quite on the dark side for a pale lager and not overly appealing.

Better than I remembered.  Pours on the dark side of yellow with thin head.  Taste - fairly grainy, dry sweetness.  Dull as anything but not unpleasant.

For what it is its decent. It doesnt taste bad and its better than Canadian, Coors, Blue etc. But still disappointing like most mass produced lagers in Canada. Not worth the price.

A very rewarding and easy drinking lager. This brew is full bodied and very well balanced. Pleasing to the eye and nose as well. I enjoyed this offering. Recomended.
