Pale coloured, very watery, surprisingly fruity, beats drinking the water or Malta’s disgusting fruit drinks.

The aroma is very light malty with faint notes of straws. The color is golden, and it has a fine but disappearing head. It is rather bitter in the start. Do I detect brewing cereal? In the…

Bottled. Pale golden larger colour with a green hue. Good malt structure as the bottle is opened. Decent dry finish, apt with the Pakistani spicy minted lamb cutlets.

A thin pale dull lager beer. Over fizzed but very short lived head. Some fruityness but its main attribute is in serving it ice cold in the searing temperatures. 33 cl bottle sampled.
