Golden color with nearly no foam. Smells like alcohol and old beer. The taste is very wrong and alcoholic. This is perfect to test your sink.

Can. Golden color. Hint of caramel and licorice in the grainy aroma. Grainy flavor with toffee, licorice and bubblegum. Slightly perfumed. Poor, but not as bad as you might expect.
