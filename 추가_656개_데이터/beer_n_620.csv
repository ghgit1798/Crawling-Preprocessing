Can, 5% in Old Cairo. Clear pale yellow colour. Small white head. The flavour is slightly grainy with the usual sourness in the finish. Standard boring lager, but quite clean.

Can. Not impressed by this one.  A friend brought it back from Egypt.  It went down alright, but found it quite flat, with a bitter/acidic aftertaste.  Not much else to it.
