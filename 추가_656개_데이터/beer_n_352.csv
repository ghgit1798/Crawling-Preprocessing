Pale gold. Brief medium head. Sweet malty aroma, taste the same, with some weak hoppy notes. Overall - for the price it’s OK. No cheap nastiness, but it’s a quaffer and that’s it.

It is sold in the bottle here (16oz) and a good buy for session beer. Mild and unoffensive, a good one to introduce someone to an imported lager. Plus I like Dortmunders.

A decent German lager. Overall light, but has a refreshing, crisp character. Some mild mid-palate hops evolve, but in general just an average German import.
