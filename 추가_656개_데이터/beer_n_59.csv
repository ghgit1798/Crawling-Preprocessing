Only my 2nd lambic, and I think I'm a fan of the style. Has a very dry woodiness, metallic flavor, but it is truly yummy. Fruity, mouth-puckeringly sour.

Refreshingly dry.  All of the soury goodness to be expected of a good lambic.  The more of it I drink, the more I notice and the more I love.

Incredibly complex sourness in the malt and a perfect finish. My favorite geuze. Drinking it in the brewery may have added to that, but still a world class beer.

Hazy, amber, thin head. The aroma is a bit cheddary, has a lactic tartness and a little bit of yeastiness.  Earthy, woody and a hit of lactic in the finish. Simpler than I remember.
