golden color, little head, medium carbonation. Weak nose, kind of sweet, also some melon. Light hoppy and grainy taste, weak though not as bad as I expected.

Ugh. What a clunker. Canned corn in the nose, yellow color, foamy head. Thin quick malt base that evaporates instantly into a fleeting dry bitter. You can do without this...

Canned. Didn’t expect such low ratings... Pale straw colour and big thick foamy head. There are some hops both in aroma and palate. Not as ugly as many of its contenders.

Foamy head. Thin weak taste with metallic aftertaste. Very uninviting colour and texture. Ugly can.

Strongly carbonated and has no taste of malt at all. Head invisible. Because amount of carbonation ending has bitter palate (in totally wrong way).

A blonde beer with a head that disappears while you put the bottle down. This is a popular beer in Sweden, but it has to do with price, not quality.

Pale, yellow colour. Decent head, some lacing. No aroma! Very thin and watery. The flavour comes late and reminds me of green apples sprayed with insecticide.
