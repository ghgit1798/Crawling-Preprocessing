From old tasting notes. Pale yellow gold color. Lots of bubbles. Sweet winey malt aroma. Tasty fruity malt flavor hints at toaste bread. Decent body and flavor. Light herbal…

This was one of my favorite beers back in the late 90’s. I was so sad to see it go. From what I know, it is no longer available.

First off, this beer rocks.  It’s nice and refreshing, with good citrus and malt flavors, comes in a big thirst quenching bottle, and the label is just tough.  One of the finest malt…

Purchased at Hall’s, Colleyville Tx. Agree with everyone’s comments so far about this being better than expected, I really thought it’d be a drain pour. Clear gold pour, soft whit…

Pours dull and lifeless, with yellow food coloring and high carbonation.  Flavor is typical skunk lager, with sour malt and lifeless hops. However, unlike most malt liquor/lagers, it’s…

The middle of the road comment is on target. Not offensive or bad, just doesn''t grab me in the least. Can you say lawn mower?

I found notes from last years tasting of this African lager, which was part of ""international beer quest"" at a chain eatery. ""Middle of the road"" is the qoute that sums it up.

Fine, but nothing earth-shattering. The only place I've had this was at Old Chicago, and it was prohibitively expensive (8 bucks for 22 oz., I think) for what was inside. Malty, firm,…
