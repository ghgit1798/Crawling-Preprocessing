Good beer with a limon. Kind of like a Corona but a little bit better. I also enjoy having a painted bottle.

Had this is a side by side horizontal tasting with Arriba (another La Constancia product) to see if they are the same products and my conclusion is no, they are not. Both have…

Skunky, malty aroma. Slightly tangy/citric and malty, and it was actually better than I thought that it was going to be. Finish is a little fruit-tarty, like some kind of candy.  This was…

Bottle.  A white gold color with a laced white head.  Skunk in the nose but not in the flavor.  Very light, a tad dry, and not offensive.

Crystal clear with no carbonation and little head, if any.  Light malty nose.  Very light and slightly citrusy flavor; better balanced version of Corona.  Ok.
