Bad beer. Bland. Taste anyone? Skunky aroma x 2! Kind of refreshing I guess if it’s ultra hot outside. But of course, a glass of water is also refreshing in those conditions.

""Mythos"" is apparently Greek for ""crap"".  Miller Lite in Cyrillic.  When you're in, say, Belgium, drink the beer.  In Greece, drink the retsina.  Or water.  Or pretty much anything but Mythos.
