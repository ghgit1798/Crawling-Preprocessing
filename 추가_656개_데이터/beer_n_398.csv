A watered-down Corona. That said, somewhat enjoyable. This is what Coors Light should have been: Not too sweet, not too sour. Middle ground brew that I usually find fresh.

At least there is a little graininess on the palate. Unlike Corona, does not come in a clear glass bottle, which helps. Definitely needs a lime, even so.
