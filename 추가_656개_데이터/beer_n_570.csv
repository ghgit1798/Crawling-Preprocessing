Bottle. A laid back pilsner with a soft but still attractively herbal bitterness. Sweet, salty and mildly malty. It sits there, you drink it, there's some flavour, then it's gone.

A very nice surprise indeed in Africa.  It seems that a german brewer is making excellent lagers in Namibia.  Very pleasant hoppy, flowery nose and a beer similar to Becks. Brewed…

Pale yellow. Overcarbonation produced a large head. Smells like a sock after a trip through the Kalihari. Doesn't taste as bad as it smells, crisp and refreshing if not a bit skunky.

Was promising as it claimed to be brewed under the ""Rheinheitsgebot"".  In reality it is a weak and pathetic facsimile of a quality german pils (see Bitburger pils).
