Perfumy nose, pale gold color, foamy head. Medicine taste - like amonia. Maybe some lemon flavors if you look real head. Thin, watery, essentially undrinkable.

This would be allright to drink at the beach...if fresh water isn't available.  It wasn't as bad as I was expecting, there's some hop flavor in this, but not a quality product.

It's slogan is ""Pasion de Espana"".  Perhaps it should be ""Poison de Espana"".  This was vile.  Phenolic, corny and nearly undrinkable.  Skunky.  An all-round pass.

As soon as I opened this beer it smelled skunky.  Then there was no smell like it lost everything. The flavour was very weak. It would not be worth buying again.

A middle of the road lager. Decent nose and a bit of a hop aftertaste. Not bad but there are certainly much better brews out there so why bother?

Blond lager. Cheap aroma of soda and light malt. Simple taste, but pretty enjoyable dry character and bitterness, also pretty strong palate. A good one among the Heinekens.
