Dark beer, nothing to write home about. Simple dark characteristics, no chocolate, malty-ish, light on the alcohol. A bit thin but a pleasant enough brew to have a few of.

Very light, generally, caramel water. It is pleasure to drink it during summer. But not worth it. The one made in Poland is shit, don’t drink it. Czech is fine in summer.

Dark and malty and the flavour is sweet, but not cloying, and it has notes of caramel. It’s easy to drink but it could have more depth. (Early rating, and too short)
