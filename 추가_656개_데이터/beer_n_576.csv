Det här var en rätt så smakfull lageröl med en seriös bitterhet. Kroppen är okej men balansen är inte helt på plats, smaken bar toner av torkat hö och lite krydda.

@ Havregatan. Flaska från Systembolaget (17:-). Malt, bröd, lite humle och hö/gräs i doften. Samma saker i smaken, som är hyfsat besk, men tyvärr har en kort eftersmak.
