This beer has a somewhat more noticeable bitterness, and its mixture of malts and rice makes it rather dry. With a refreshing feeling, balanced bouquet and full body, it works…

Pours a very light yellow color with a thin head that vanishes instantly.  Smells like corn and tastes like water.  Sadly, that makes it the best beer Costa Rica has to offer.
