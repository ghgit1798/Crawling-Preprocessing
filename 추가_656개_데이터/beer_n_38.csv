Always a reliable beer on tap or from the bottle.  Nice yeast and a bit of malt on the tongue with a crisp hit of hops.  Well balanced and always good if you cant find any craft brews.

This beer is legit! One of the best Hefeweizen’s I’ve ever had and I love it’s unique taste. The strong banana and citrus-like tastes set this beer apart from other Hef’s.

I’ll be short.  This is my go-to hefe.  It’s regularly $1.99 at my local Vons, which is a-ok by me.  No, it’s not the best Hefe, but it’s damn good, especially for the price.  Widely available.

Biggest banana flavor I've had in a weissbier yet. Other than that, not much to speak of. For the price, however, it's probably the best Weissbier you can get in the States.
