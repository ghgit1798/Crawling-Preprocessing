Pale blond color. Bread corn and rice aroma. Dry and quite bad flavor. Ends quite bitter. I would say, not even interesting at that latitude.

Tanzanian beer. Not so bad for a classic lager. Light body, light finish, refreshing. To be drunk in africa, not realy worst elsewhere.

Color reminds me of a serengit lager, which looks like piss, dont judge a book by it's cover. Much better in taste, but nothing to scream about.

Watery lager with a slightly hoppy finish.  I waited to try it until after climbing the mountain.  Definitely not worth the wait.  After coming off the mountain I would have rather…

Bland little lager with a very pleasant little noble hop finish.  The finish makes this one worth trying.

After climbing 20,000ft to the top of Kili, you deserve better then this when you get to the bottom. Try the Tusker Larger instead.
