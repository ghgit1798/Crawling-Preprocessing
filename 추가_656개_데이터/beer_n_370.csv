An American Standard.  Apparently a big seller in Finland where I bought it, yet it's indistinguishable from Lapin Kulta, Koff or any of its lagery competitors.

Blond beer with a small creamy head. Hop and yeast aroma. Short yeasty and hoppy taste. A typical blond lager meant for mass consumption. Flat and tasteless.

Bitter, skunky aroma. Opens up bitter and watery, some malt sweetishness. Weak, faintly moldy and bitter aftertaste. Leaves a nasty film in the mouth. Feh. I won't buy this again.

Bit less alchohol than in Urho IVA. Otherwise about the same, perhaps a bit better. Unpleasant aroma. Watery. Aftertaste not very strong. Bit sweet.
