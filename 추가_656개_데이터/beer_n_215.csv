Tenerife 06. Straw with an OK head. The aroma has notes of malt and hops, just like the flavour, that has an OK bitterness. The overall impression is a very light and boring beer. 1565

A light yellow beer with next to no head. Both the aroma and flavor mostly remind me of dishwash water, and the flavor is even sour from brewing cereal.
