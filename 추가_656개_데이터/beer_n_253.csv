A bland, flavor-neutral anerican standard with a little graininess/soapiness to distract from the lack of flavor/taste.  Totally innocuous and boring.

Smelled like unripe apples, grassy and grain. Yellow with a little head. It tasted like cider but very watery. It wasn't terrible, so I will give a few points for that.

In the genre of, but a big step up from, bud. Of course, that's not really saying much.  Tastes better with tangy/zesty food.
