Typical light bodied yellow lager, ala Corona.  A nice thirst quencher while hanging out in the pool at Sandals in St. Lucia.  Not bad for a little beer from a third world country.

Bottled on St. Lucia. Pretty standard lager; not much I can say about it. It’s yellow, it has alcohol, and it comes in a bottle.
