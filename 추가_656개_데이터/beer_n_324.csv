This beer is really poor. I wanted to like it due to it being a new country beer for me. Yet it was really uneventful.  A bit International lagerish.

Golden pour with thin white head. Malt, a little caramel aroma, grainy and a bit funky. Taste is malty, richer than expected, but grainy. Not bad, not great.
