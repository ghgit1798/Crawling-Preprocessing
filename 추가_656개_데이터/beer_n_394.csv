Probably one of the better pale lagers available which isn’t saying much. Very drinkable but not much for flavour or character.

Tastes Quite a bit like Labatt Blue.  Both seem to be quite bland and no after taste. No real finish for anyone to enojoy. Meant for drinking in abundance it seems.

Gets a failing grade. I'm not sure what the hype is all about. It's quite similar to Labatt's Blue, and you know what I think of Blue(check out my ratings). Bland and overrated.

A macro lager that is quite popular in Washington state.  Bit of oily complexity on the palate puts it ahead of BudMillerCoors, but not by much. Avoid.

Pale straw, sweet creamed corn and grain character.  Not a ton of hop but search hard enough and you’ll find a touch.  Sweet, but there’s worse.   And I’ll note that it is pretty clean.
