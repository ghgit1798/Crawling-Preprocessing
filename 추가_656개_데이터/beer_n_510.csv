Unfortunate name that sums up the beer. Pretty tasteless and bland. Suppose it wouuld be quite refeshing on a sun kissed Thai beach-so would a cup of tea.

Bottled. Super clear, pale golden body with steady, well formed white head.  Gaseous chemical aroma that stifles. Surprisingly hoppy flavour with a long drawn out bitter finish.

The aroma is hoppy and grassy - pretty simple. The color is yellow, and it has a small disappearing head. The flavor is sweet malty and sour - very simple and boring.

Bottled. Pale golden. Obvious adjunct aroma. Light bodied, crisp and clean. Boring perhaps, nut not too bad.

Pale yellow with a small vanishing head. Slightly acidic aroma with some malt. Taste of...hmmm...rice?Carbonated emptiness? Aftertaste? Forget it. I'm not surprised.
