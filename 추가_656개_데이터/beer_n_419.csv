Not worth wasting any writing on. But anyway: Fine white head......? This is all the positive there is to bee written. The rest of this beer is bad.

Bottled. Pale golden, rich but brief head. Corn aroma. Sweet and metallic. Loads of adjuncts. No bitterness. Tasteless, but not offensive.

Intresting taste, Tastes like a cross between Budweiser and Peroni.  Not very fond of this brew but its much better than budweiser!  Tastes very watered down!

Brazilians pronounce this one ""Ant-OKT-chee-kah"" and rate it as one of their best. I failed to see why, although it is very cheap. It is a very light straw colour and is easy drinking, but…

Little bit of a skunky aroma. Clean and clear appearance with active bubbles throughout. Quite refreshing. Smooth going down.

Pale color, slightly sour aroma, significant sourness in the taste-but it’s a very nice sour, otherwise this brew is crisp and refreshing with a touch of bitterness, I’m just so delighted…
