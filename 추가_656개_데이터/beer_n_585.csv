A mild, inoffensive lager, typical of all lagers brewed in all developing countries.  I know the Ethiopians can do better than this.  Pass.

Malty, sweet aromas with a little grassiness.  Thin, white head that dissipates quickly.  Clear gold.  Not much on the flavor side ... a bit of malt and very little hops.
