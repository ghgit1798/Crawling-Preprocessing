Golden apperance with disappointing head. Maltier in aroma and has a bit more character than other Finnish big lagers. Seems to have improved in the last years.

Tapped. Golden colour, not much head. Malty aroma and taste with bitter aftertaste. Should change name to Kurjala (=lousy). I just hated it every moment while drinking it.

Oakes is right.  This is virtually identical to Karhu, and to Koff III.  A mild international lager with little flavor and only light, distant hops.
