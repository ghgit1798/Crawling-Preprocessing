Bottle. Not much of interest here. Drinkable, but without character. Pale malt and a slight sprinkling of hops in the finish.

Golden yellow coloured. Hoppy aroma, bitter flavour. Another bohemian pilsener. Not very special, but drinkable.

Hoppy aroma. Bitter taste. Reminded me of my visit to the Pilsner Urquell brewery. Quite nice refreshing pils.

unappealing aroma. Golden yellow, nice head and lacing for a pilsener. Body is fairly thick and creamy. A nice malt presence and a crisp aftertaste. An excellent example of its style.

Typical straw colour with little foam.  Aroma was slightly doughy with notes of grass.  Taste is quite sweet and oily feeling.  Beer seems to be sugary water with little flavour.

(bottle) Yech!  Strange, slightly sugary aroma, head vanishes almost instantly.  Flavor is also sweet and malty, but finish is really lacking some umpf here.

An interesting combination of sweetness and traditional Pilsener.  Sweetness is cookie like almost like a honey beer.  The hops could be stronger but satisfying none the less.…

Quite frankly, these guys should brew coffee or something else instead of beer. Cannot think of much positive about this one - don't even like the label on the bottle..

This is what I desire in a Czech style pilsener.  Firm saaz hopping in bitterness and flavor/aroma balanced by a nice firm maltiness.  Very well balanced.
