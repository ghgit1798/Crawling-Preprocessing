Not what I expected.  It has not so much a chocolate taste as a old person woody taste.  It’s a little off putting if you try to focus on it.  It keeps its head all the way to the bottom.

12 oz bottle.  Flavor starts off with lots of bitter chocolate, then moves to dry stout and ends with a crisp finish.  I’d call it a dry stout, not a sweet stout.

This is an extremely rich and very delicious stout.  The chocolate flavor is pulled off very well and mixes nicely with this superb ale.  Not too roasted tasting, just creamy.

This beer is like a dessert.  Dark, chocolate, and smooth.  The taste doesn’t linger, however.   Not real complext, just chocolate.  If you don''t usually like stouts, give this one a try.
