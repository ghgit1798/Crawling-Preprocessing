33cl can.  Gold, thick white head.  Slightly metallic stale cereal aroma.  Faint lemon hop.  Some creaminess.  Yeah it’s ok.  It’s a lager with some nice crispness on finish.

First ""exotic import"" I ever tried, at Old Chicago in 1997. As I recall, it was nothing special, a Dutch-style pilsner in the mold of Heinie or Grolsch. In other words, spend 6 bucks…

This stuff is fairly rough on the gut - Kiwi's don't drink the stuff at home - very hoppy kind of beer.

And I thought Heine could smell skunky. Sweeter than most lagers. Sometimes a bit tough to finish a large bottle. Do yourself a favor....don't let this beer get warm.

Somewhat boring. Non abrasive texture. Fluffy, thick head. If anything, a good thirst quencher. Always a bit skunky but not harsh enough to ruin it.

Pale gold indicates a lighter beer. Some decent hops initially comes through in the aroma; slightly skunky however due to green bottles. Malt flavor seems to stay in the background.…

Did Moosehead start putting their beer in these bottles?  It's a light lager, mildly skunky, not much there.
