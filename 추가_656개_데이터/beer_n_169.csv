Great copper color.  Nothing special when it comes to aroma but the flavor makes up for it.  High alcohol and a flavor on the sweet side makes this a good porter to sip.  Worth a try.

Not as Roasty or rich as other Baltic Porters that I have tried.  Alcohol is strong and overpowering, but it does help out  the weak hops with providing a dry end to each mouthfull.

Tastes too strongly of alcohol to be one of my favorites.  Has sort of a thick, lasting creamy head.  It''s no masterpiece, but is worth trying if you like a stronger porter.
