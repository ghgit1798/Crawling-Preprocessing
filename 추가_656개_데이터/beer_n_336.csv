Bottle.  Barnyard malt aroma.  Golden yellow color with ample head.  Slighty sweet creamy malt flavor with a very light hops finish.  Not great but quite enjoyable.

Light amber ale, no head to speak of. Pale larger style nose, smells a little stale. Fairly uneventful palate, fizzy, faint malts, ok zesty feel.  Doesn’t really show appeal.

A decent beer though somewhat mild and sudsy.  Could drink it as a regular quaffer.  Could be a little drier.

Pretty light malt, high carbonation and a bit of spicy, soapy (Lublin?) hop. Way better than Aussie megalagers but probably not as good as its Russian or Polish neighbours.

The head is good and longlasting. The taste is a little sour including elements of caramel. However, the beer goes well for a pilsener because of the strong hop-aroma.
