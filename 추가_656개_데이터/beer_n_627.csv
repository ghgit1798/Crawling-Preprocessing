Lager arabski to jeszcze gorzej niż afrykański, czuć stęchliznę, dość ładny ale tylko lekko słomkowy kolor. Aromat nie ujawnia się, piana mała biała. Bardzo słabe.

На удивление оказалось очень вкусное пиво. Наконец то добрался до Алжира. Остальное Алжирское пиво также очень вкусное.

Pours gold with a white head.  Smells of corn meal, some wet cardboard.  Tastes of corn, pine, some skunky hints.  Unbalanced, messy beer.

Probably best to drink the wine if you visit Algeria.  This is an average lager, medium body, some bitterness in the finish, otherwise pretty boring.
