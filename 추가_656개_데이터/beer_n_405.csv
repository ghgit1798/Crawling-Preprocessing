Extremely clear extra pale yellow with no head.  Corn and grain.  Very boring.  The bottle packaging is the best thing going for this beer.  I love the hand-grenade styling.

I first had this beer in Cozumel. One of the best Mexican style beers. I was a Sol enthusiast until I tasted this beer. Does anyone know if I can buy it in the states?
