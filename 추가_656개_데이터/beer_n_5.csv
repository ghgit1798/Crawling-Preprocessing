It is a classical beer but in Munich you have better breweries. We can feel the malt and the hop is not really present. It is a beer to start an aperitive but it is a bit boring.

500ml Canned. Quite pale, looks almost like a witbier. Aroma ok, bit of yeast and flour. The taste is hoppy but completely without imagination or complexity. Still drinkable though.

An underated and really good beer. I especially like the motley crue story about how this helped with their name. Good beer.
