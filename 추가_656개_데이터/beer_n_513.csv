Been to Singapore, but I’ve never tried their beer, so Tiger it was.  Pretty plain beer, similar to many North American beers.  It’s a good beer, but far from anything special.

For an Asian beer, this is not too bad. Far more flavour than e.g. Thailand's Singha. I've never been to Singapore, but can imagine Tiger Beer would be great in the the tropical heat…

Very well balanced, smooth and tasty.  Had the luck to have both a bottle and canned versions.  Both very close witht the bottle being a little more crisp.

This is a nice dry lager, perhaps more suited to the Singapore heat than an English spring day.  Still refreshing, though.  Adendum, I must have been drunk!  Points deduction!

A pleasant but very boring lager. A bit more aromatic and sweet compared to traditional lagers. The finish is only lightly bitter though (and frankly pretty bland).

A very tasty aromatic lager. Sweetish taste with complex overtones of barley bread and spiciness. Excellent balance between malts and hops.

Smooth, drinkable lager. However, I wouldn't buy it again because it is similar in style and taste to many local lagers but much more expensive.

This is by far the best beer around.  I grew up in Singapore and I was raised on Tiger, so that might explain why I like it so much.  Nothing beats a tall cold tiger draft on a hot night…

Pale yellow.  Odd esters in the nose - pear, green apple - always a sign of a failed lager.  Light and watery, with some slight fusel influence.  Unclean, hopless, a total drain pour.
