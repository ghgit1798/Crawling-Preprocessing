Un pequeño sabor a Malta, nada especial como cualquier lager industrial. Un amargor decente, aunque esperaba más. Igualmente entra muy bien el verano para refrescar.

Bottle, a clear gold with a white frothy head. A grassy and metallic aroma. A clean palate, but slightly sweet. The hops then kick in, not too grassy. The finish is short and metallic.

Bottle. Description: the typical industrial lager. This is the Quilmes of Mendoza. Maybe a little better because of the water of the mountains and a little more body.
