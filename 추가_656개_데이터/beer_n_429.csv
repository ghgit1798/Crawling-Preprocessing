12oz bottle in Bogota, Feb, 2013. Not a bad beer. Light and flavorful. Not sure why they only brew it during the winter months as it would be a great summer beer.

Not as bad as I was afraid it would be.  Tastes just bland and blah.   A little bit like cheerios and sweet corn.  No skunkiness which is cool.
