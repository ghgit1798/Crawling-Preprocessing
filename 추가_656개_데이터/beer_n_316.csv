Bottle in Dubrovnik.  Reveals its Czech heritage.  Good bier, nothing remarkable that is worth trying if you’re in Croatia.  It was refreshing during the summer.

Nice golden colour.  You can smell the saaz and taste it as well.  Nice bubbly  soft head.  Starts off a little bitter but really grows on you and makes you want another.

Standard golden. Slightly hoppy and a grainy zest that makes it stick out a bit from others like it. Well concealed alcohol.
