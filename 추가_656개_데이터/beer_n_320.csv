Nice But not as nice as the Laško, slightly sweeter than the former. Better drunk from bottles or on tap as cans taste like cans.

This slightly sucked.  Typical run of the mill maltiness, kind of tasted like straw and had some grassy hoppiness  Has some small light fruitiness, kind of bland and boring.

In a bar in Ljubljana, from a bottle. Nice cripsy Lager, with good freshness in the balanced sweet maltiness. This won’t pull up trees, but it did the job.

Pour is yellow with a white head.  Aroma is corny and metalic.  Flavor is not that bad b/c there is not much to it.  Goes down clean and a bit of citrus.  Better than the smile but not much.

I believe that this is the biggest selling Pivo in Slovenia. It's thin and lacking in malt character. Pale yellow with thick head, it's merely a cold thirst quencher.
