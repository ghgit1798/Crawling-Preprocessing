Not bad on a hot day in Hungary while riding in a train bar car.  I don't think I would order a case of it special delivery but overall it is a nice beer for a summer day.

This is a pretty average lager. Nothing special, a bit hoppy and malty. The beer does'nt has any special characteristics that I can comment on. Pretty stable head though.
