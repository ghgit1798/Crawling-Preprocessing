Liek a Guinness only golden color.  Creamy mouthfeel...like melted vanilla ice cream.  Subtle flavor of cream, some hops.  A littel watery, but this beer is all about the creaminess.

The nitro widget used here is the key in stepping this brew up a notch. Hazy gold with a durable, dense white head; very creamy and smooth; moderate hop and slighty sour malt‚Ä¶
