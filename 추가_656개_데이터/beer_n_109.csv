Creamy head from the nitrogen makes for a great looking beer.  Very pale in color, almost a light yellow.  Not really my cup of tea but I would take this over a Budweiser any day.

Can. This was not very good at all. It’s beer in a can. That’s what it tastes like. No smell. Looks like cheap can beer and has no taste. Maybe it’s old. I would not recommend this one.

Verrrrrrrry creamy.  Head & lacing lasts forever.  Looks terrific off the tap.  Flavor is lacking though - not much character or bitterness to speak of.  Extremely smooth though...

Beautiful to the eyes, but I don't like its peculiar flavor at all.  Its not bitter, just weird tasting.

After the appearance and aroma, I was expecting a much better beer.  Not terrible, but I'd take a Caffrey's any day over this.
