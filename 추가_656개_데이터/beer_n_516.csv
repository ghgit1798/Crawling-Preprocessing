The deep amber color, thick creamy head, and rich flavor are most important qualities of this beer. It has a light body and smooth texture. Good drink to share a conversation with.

Very satisfying beer that is dominated by a robust bready malt profile. There is a bit of an astringency on the finish, or it could just be very, very dry. Overall I loved it.

Copper/Dark yellow with head.  Interesting beer that treads the line between ""clean crisp easy drinking"" and ""flavourful"" quite well.  Grainy malts run the show but it stays balanced.

Pours amber with small white top. Kind of bitter in taste, but also malty. I do think I also sense some butterscotch. The beer has a mild mouthfeel and goes down pretty smoothly.
