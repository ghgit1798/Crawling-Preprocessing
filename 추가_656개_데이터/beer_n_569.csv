These Minnesotans do not know how to brew beer. Take a trip to Milwaukee boys, your beer sucks.

Crisp hop taste but not to dry.  I couldn't stand this ale when I smoked, but once I quit it tasted wonderful.  Best on tap or keep bottles cold because this beer has a short shelf life.

A midwest classic.  By far better on Tap, Summit EPA never seems to travel well.  Elegant and balanced for this robust style.  More drinkable than many micro interpretations…

It's nice living around all of these small breweries so they are still affordable, because they make some of the best beers.

Very hoppy with a unique, slightly nutty, bitter aftertaste.  This is the way a Pale Ale should taste.  Most Pales tone down the hops to broaden their appeal.  Summit EPA…

One of my favorite things about the Twin Cities is that this beer flows as freely (and nearly as cheaply, in some places) as water.  Nice nuttiness, good body.  Can quaff the heck…

Found this one quite enjoyable; hoppy without being overpowering. Summit's brews are really worth checking out.

wild flora nose, very much a Northwest style pale ale; rather deep red though handsome; probably overspicy, more hops than balance; it fights you for attention after awhile
