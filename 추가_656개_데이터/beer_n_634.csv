Dark, typical Stout look. Smells sweet. Taste isn't all that remarkable.   Finish isn't as full as I typically like Stouts and I wouldn't buy it again. A more generic lable would be nice. :-D

Well, it's definatly not a dessert beer. Strong, ripe stout. not a Bell's but very straight forward. Nothing to dislike but the thin head.

This is not a very good stout. Incredibly flat with little to no head. I head this in succession with 2 other stouts and it sorely disappointed.
