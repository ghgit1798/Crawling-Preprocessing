This Koelsch has almost everything a Cologne-borne liquid bread should have. Like especially the golden color and a yeasty start. What I miss is better head retention and…

Malty aroma. Golden colour with nice head. Bit sweet, pils-like and malty flavors. Finishes a bit more hoppy.

Me, a friend, two pretty German girls and fresh Fruh Kolsh...sitting in Koln.  It doesn't get much better.  This is a great beer fresh, I've never had it any other way.

A very nice Koelsch. Goes very good with dinner. Don't try it at the big restaurant near the dome but check out the small branch ""Em Veedel"" near the Severins gate if you can.
