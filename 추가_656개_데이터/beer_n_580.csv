Bottle, at The Rake, Southwark. Pretty standard tropical lager. Mid gold colour. Loads of corn. Not much in the way of hops. Dull stuff, but not undrinkable. Got worse as it warmed.

Pale yellow with a minimal head. Typical pale lager sweet malt aroma, but at least it’s not offensive. Fairly sweet on tasting too, but enough hops to sharpen it up a touch.

Pale lager in appearance (there’s a surprise). Grapey sweet aroma, with the flavour of sweet cheap grape bubblegum. I’m sure it tastes better in Mozambique.
