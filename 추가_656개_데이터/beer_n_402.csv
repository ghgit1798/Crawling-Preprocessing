Good Mexican beer. Much more flavor than corona or modelo. Mild hop characteristic but noticeable. Squeeze some lime in there and you’ll be good.

This beer is probably not as good as my marks might suggest.    I was just so enthused about having found a Mexican beer that I can stomach.   Beer tends to go well…

You pour this sucker into the glass and it fizzes up like yellow mineral water, all life dying just as quickly. Aroma is grainy at first, but this rapidly gives way to a massive paint thinner…

Far superior to Corona, comparable to the better American macros I guess.  Not stellar, not bad either.  The points are for the fact that its so much better than Corona.

If you have to drink a beer with a lime, this is the one. Better than Corona.
