This is a beautiful beer, poured out of can with the floating thingy in it.  Great head and worth pouring just to watch.  Great taste, step better than Guiness but same overall mojo.

Flavor is alright, creamy with a hint of coffee, but the body tends to be too thin for me. If drinking stout, I'll stick to Guinness.
