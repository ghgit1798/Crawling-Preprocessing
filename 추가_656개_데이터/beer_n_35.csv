Bottle, 4.6%. Old bready aroma. Clear pale yellow colour. Big white head. The flavour is better than the aroma. Nicely citric with a little malt. Only a hint of sewer.

An orange beer with a disappearing white head. The aroma is spicy and malty - quite boring. The flavor is sweet malty leading to a dry end. A boring pilsener.
