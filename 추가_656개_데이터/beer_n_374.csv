Works best with spicy foods. The flavor is faint hints of corn and a light hop flavor and can be used as a substitute for Mexican beer.

Refreshing, as it says in the label, that is good. But when they put some corn in those beers it is ike they are devaluated.

Aroma is excellent, for a pale lager, almost pale ale’ish, flourl and grassy hops in there. Taste is not so good cardboard and not the dry finish i expected. Intresting all the same.
