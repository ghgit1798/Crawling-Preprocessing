Very blond; big head dissapearing quickly; big bubbles. I can only get hop in the aroma. Slightly bitter all the way with a staying harshness in your mouth.

Comes in a pretty cool-looking bottle.  OK pilsner at the low end of the bitterness scale, with some decent hop notes and medium body for the style.
